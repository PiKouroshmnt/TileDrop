# TileDrop Game (Practice Project)

This project is a personal exercise in JavaScript game development, inspired by classic block-stacking games, I intend for this project to be a new perspective/start
to game development using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.<br>
While I learn, you can play and have fun :)<br>
